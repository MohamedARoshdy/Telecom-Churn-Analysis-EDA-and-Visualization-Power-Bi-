# Telecom Churn Analysis - EDA & Visualization (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecom company using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Power BI Visualization**. The goal is to extract insights on customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and propose strategies to improve customer retention.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes information about **7,043 telecom customers**, covering demographics, service details, and churn status. Some key columns:
- **Customer Demographics**: Gender, Age, Number of Dependents, etc.
- **Subscription Details**: Contract Type, Internet Service, Monthly Charges, etc.
- **Churn Information**: Churn Category, Churn Reason.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** – Data Cleaning & EDA
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Exploratory Analysis
- **Power BI** – Data Visualization & Dashboarding

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Churn Rate Analysis**: Breakdown of churn by contract type, internet service, and tenure.
- **Retention Analysis**: Identifying patterns that contribute to higher customer retention.
- **Customer Tenure Trends**: Understanding the relationship between tenure and churn.

## 📊 Dashboards & Visuals
The Power BI dashboard consists of three main pages:
1. **Overview** – Project summary and key metrics.
2. **Churn Analysis** – Breakdown of churn-related factors.
3. **Retention Analysis** – Focused on customer retention strategies.

## 🚀 How to Use
### Run the EDA:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/Telecom_Churn_EDA.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute the cells to explore data trends and insights.

### Explore the Dashboard:
1. Open the Power BI file (`powerbi/Telecom_Churn_Retention.pbix`) in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Interact with the visuals to gain deeper insights.
